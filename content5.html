        <p class="title">Does your dog have a sensitive stomach?</p>

        <p class="para">Dogs are omnivores, which means they consume both meat and veggies. Because of their wide palette and ability to consume large amounts of food in one sitting, they have a gluttonous reputation (owing to an incredibly elastic stomach). While most dogs are not afraid to consume almost any meal (or non-food!) that comes their way, others are more sensitive. Your dog's stomach might be upset for a variety of causes, ranging from indigestion to cancer. While all dogs vomit from time to time, it's time to take your dog to the vet for a check-up if they vomit or have diarrhoea on a regular or continuous basis. Chronic or recurring vomiting or diarrhoea suggests that your dog's health is failing and should be addressed. Your veterinarian will be able to examine your dog and, if necessary, conduct tests to provide an accurate diagnosis and treatment.</p>

        <p class="para">What is a sensitive stomach?</p>

        <p class="para">The occurrence of flatulence or diarrhoea in some dogs, just like it happens in people if something upsets their stomach. This is referred to as a 'sensitive stomach'. We're talking about a modest digestive disturbance here, which ranges from a rumbling gut and unpleasant odours from the back end to vomiting and diarrhoea.
            Some dogs have sensitive stomachs from birth, while others develop them later in life. In any case, it is something that must be handled if your dog is to prosper. Nausea, vomiting, excessive gas, and diarrhoea with or without blood in the stool are symptoms of a dog’s sensitive stomach. Supplemental therapy will be used in response to the symptoms they have experienced.
           
            </p>

        <p class="para"> The symptoms should go away if you change your pet's diet to something easier for them to digest. It is also not normal if your dog has been vomiting or diarrhoea for a long time. To rule out illnesses like allergies and gastrointestinal disorders or sickness, you should take them to the veterinarian as soon as possible. You can even discuss changing to food for dogs with sensitive stomachs with them.</p>
        <p class="para">How can your dog get a sensitive stomach?
            </p>

        <p class="para">Your dog's sensitive stomach could be hereditary, meaning it was there at birth. When your puppy is young, you may notice that they have trouble digesting food, have gas, and have irregular faeces.
            It's simple to figure out if your dog's food is the problem, though it may take some willpower on your part. Start by removing any unnecessary foods from his diet. Table scraps, leftovers, bones, treats, and anything else your dog might enjoy nibbling on throughout the day are all included. Check to see whether your dog is slipping into the trash, garbage bin, waste thrown on roads or any other forbidden treasures that can cause your dog to get sick. This will help you better diagnose your dog's stomach problem.</p>
        
        <p class="para"> How food can be the cause of a sensitive stomach in your dog?</p>
        <p class="para"> Every dog is unique in its way. Some canines are capable of digesting anything that enters their stomach while others are bothered by even the tiniest change in their diet.
 
            •	Protein: Some dogs have trouble digesting certain forms of protein. If your dog is on a chicken-based diet, for example, consider moving to a different protein source, such as lamb, or fish, to see if the problem goes away.
            •	Fibre: Dogs, like us, sometimes require a little additionalfibre in their diets. Beet pulp is a rich source of fibre for dogs, and it improves faecal quality without reducing other nutrient digestibility.
            •	Fats: High-fat diets are more difficult to digest than low-fat or high-carbohydrate diets. Check the first four ingredients on your dog's current diet for fats and oils. This could mean the food is too heavy in fat for your dog's digestive system to handle. Compare the fat content of your current food to that of other brands to locate a fat-free option.
            •	Vitamins & Minerals: The majority of commercial dog diets have enough vitamins and minerals in their recipes. However, if you provide a speciality food to your dogs, such as a raw diet or a freshly cooked dinner, your dog may be deficient in some nutrients. Consult your veterinarian to ensure that you are providing your dog with all of the necessary nutrients.

        <p class="para"> What food to avoid at all costs? </p>
        <p class="para"> As a savvy pet owner, it's critical to know when to put the food down, and to pay close attention to what you're feeding your dog. Here are some foods that should never be feeding your dog.
 
            •	Chocolate: This delectable sweet can be a dangerous threat to your dogs. Chocolate includes a chemical called 'Theobromine' and an artificial sweetener like ‘Xylitol’ which is harmless to humans but hazardous to dogs. It's abundant in dark chocolate and baking chocolate, in particular. It can make your dog vomit, have diarrhoea, and drink excessively.
            •	Salty Food: Salt poisoning, also known as sodium ion poisoning, can result in excessive thirst or urine. Eating salty meals can cause vomiting, diarrhoea, high body temperature, seizures, and bloating as a result of the excessive water your dog drinks to quench his thirst.
            •	Fried & Fatty Meat: Pancreatitis in dogs can be caused by high-fat diets. They might also cause gastrointestinal irritation due to the high salt content. Make sure your meat is well cooked at all times. It should never be served raw or undercooked, as this too might cause stomach problems.
            •	Milk and Dairy: Lactose intolerance affects many dogs, which means they lack the enzyme needed to break down milk sugar. Dairy can cause vomiting, diarrhoea, and gastrointestinal disorders in dogs. Pancreatitis can be caused by the high-fat content. It can also cause a variety of food sensitivities as well as itching.
            </p>
        <p class="para"> Regardless of the food you feed your dog, they may have chronic vomiting, nausea, and other GI-related problems. A past or recently established health problem, such as pancreatitis, colitis, or a malabsorption disorder, could be to blame.</p>
        <p class="para"> How to know that your dog has a sensitive stomach?</p>
        <p class ="para"> Intermittent loose stools or diarrhoea, nausea, giving up on eating food, licking their lips, swallowing a lot, and excessive gas are all classic symptoms of a sensitive stomach. Your dog's stools may include blood, and they may vomit. A dog whose stomach is inflamed may become less lively and refuse to go for a walk. Just like humans, dogs too pass gas or have loose stools, but if the symptoms are long-lasting and you observe weight loss, consult a veterinarian.</p>
        <p class="para "> Keep a lookout for these symptoms that may indicate digestive trouble in case of your dogs:
            •	Lack of appetite
            •	Nausea
            •	Vomiting
            •	Excessive gas (Farting or burping)
            •	Diarrhoea
            •	Blood in stool
            •	Decreased mobility
            •	Fever
            •	Excessive stomach growling
            </p>
        <p class="para"> Furthermore, extended exposure to symptoms may result in a bunch of serious problems. If your dog's digestive system is delicate and their meal irritates their gastrointestinal tract, this might result in frequent vomiting and ulceration. Talk to your vet about the best diet for senior dogs with sensitive stomachs to help them get their digestive system back on track. If your dogs’ disturbing symptoms are showing no signs of improvement, testing for underlying disorders may be necessary.</p>
        <p class="para"> How to treat a dog with a sensitive stomach? </p>
        <p class="para"> Your dog's symptoms and lab test findings will determine the treatment approach. The blood tests will reveal whether an inability to digest food adequately is impacting the health of any internal organs. If your dog is exhibiting certain health problems, your veterinarian will assess whether or not they are due to sensitivity</p>
        <p class="para"><ul><li>Medication: If your dog has an ulcer in the GI system, drugs will be given to ease the ulcer and apply a protective coating to it. This will help your dog recuperate faster and be more comfortable. To soothe your dog's digestive tract, anti-vomiting medicine will be given. To get your dog's gut health back to normal, probiotics will be administered. Your dog's veterinarian will prescribe more medications if they deem them essential.</li>
           <li>Diet: For some time or the rest of their lives, your dog may need to be transferred to a diet that better suits their sensitive stomach. There are prescription diets with high-quality components available, or you can discuss them with your veterinarian to rule out which ingredient your dog is allergic to. Your veterinarian may suggest a highly digestible dog food, such as one with beet pulp as a fibre source, or one without a lot of fat, which many dogs have trouble digesting.</li> 
            <li>Supplements: Supplements can be added to your dog's diet to help keep his digestive system in good shape. Your veterinarian will address any additional nutritional requirements your dog has. Your dog's diet will be unique to them because of their sensitivity.</li>
