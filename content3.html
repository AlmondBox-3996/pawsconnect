        <p class="para">1. Skin and fur care</p>

        <p class="para">Different cats have different grooming needs. Don't forcefully make your cat do anything. Cats don't like to be pressured. Create a calm and quiet environment before you start with the main process. Once you find your cat relaxing, go with a few pets and cuddles first, then move on with the brushing. 
            Tip: Don't use a comb with plastic bristles. It generates an electric charge which might shock your cat.

A bath could be a good option if they have made a mess of themselves or have touched anything that could potentially be hazardous to them. Helpful tools for a good bath can be Cat shampoo and a bathmat.

        <p class="para"> 4.Dental care</p>

            Tip: Chew toys are also great at keeping your cattos teeth strong, massaging gums, and flossing!</p>
            
        <p class="para"> 5. Cleaning ears</p>
        <p class="para"> In cats, ear cleaning is typically not required. Although the majority of cats do just fine without it, ear cleaning can be a crucial aspect of your cat's hygiene needs if they are prone to ear infections or wax buildup. The easiest way to clean your cat's ears is by using ear cleaning solutions. Squeeze some ear cleaning solution into your cat’s ear. You can also use cat ear cleaning wipes to clean your feline’s ears.
            Tip: Always treat your cat once you are done with the ear cleaning process. This will make her feel pampered and happy.
